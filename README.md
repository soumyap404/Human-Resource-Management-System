# WorkSphere - Human Resource Management System (HRMS)

WorkSphere is a modern Human Resource Management System (HRMS) designed to simplify and automate everyday HR operations. It provides a centralized platform for managing employee information, attendance, leave requests, and payroll while offering role-based access for employees and administrators.

 Overview
Managing HR processes manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. WorkSphere streamlines these operations by providing an intuitive web application that enables employees and HR administrators to efficiently manage workforce-related activities.

The system supports secure authentication, role-based authorization, attendance tracking, leave management, employee profile management, and payroll visibility through a clean and responsive user interface.
